                <h2>About the Hakarimata</h2>
                <p>The native forest and birdlife of the Hakarimata Range provides the perfect setting for a day out in
				one of the Waikato
				regionâ€™s most beautiful landscapes. Located in the town Ngaruawahia, the ranges include 1,850
				hectares of native forest protected in Hakarimata Scenic
				Reserve. A walk in the reserve will reward you with babbling streams, picturesque waterfalls and
				impressive views over
				the surrounding countryside.</p>
                <p>The track that most people do and is still a challange for many is the Waterworks track which is in
				the middle section of the Hakarimata Secenic Reserve. If you choose to go to the summit you will
				climb 374 metres above sea level, on the Hakarimata Summit Track, which includes the infamous
				staircase, a popular challange with both locals and vistors alike.</p>
                <p>The location of the Hakarimata Track entrance is off Brownlee Avenue, off the Ngaruawahia end of
				Hakarimata Road. The average return time of the Waterworks Track is 1 hour return.</p>
